### POKEDEX GO ###

My attempt to build a pokedex similar to the offical pokemon go app

### Tech ###
It uses the pokeapi.co API (v2) to fetch some details of the pokemons.

The list of pokemons and evolutions is in the pokemon.csv file

Was built using swift, with the following libraries:

* Alamofire - to fetch the description, height and weight
* SwiftyJSON - to made the life easier to decode the json from the api
